#summary Configuration guidelines

ClearParser requires a configuration file in XML.  The following shows contents of the default configuration file (`config/config_default.xml`).

{{{
<configuration>
    <common>
        <language>en</language>
        <format>dep</format>

<*configuration*> is the top-level element that consists of 3 elements: <*common*>, <*liblinear*>, and <*predict*>.
<br><br>

== <*common*> ==

The <*common*> element is required for both training and decoding.  It consists of 5 required elements.

 * <*language*> ::= ch | en | hi
  * Specifies a language (ch: Chinese, en: English, hi: Hindi)
 * <*format*> ::= raw | pos | dep | srl | conll
  * Specifies a [DataFormat data format]
 * <*lexicon_dir*> ::= absolute or relative path
  * Specifies a directory path that contains lexicon files (automatically generated during the training)
 * <*model_file*> ::= absolute or relative path
  * Specifies a filename of the dependency model (generated by [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/ LibLinear])
 * <*feature_xml*> ::= absolute or relative path
  * Specifies a filename of the [featureGuidelines feature template in XML]

== <*liblinear*> ==

The <*liblinear*> element is required for training.  It consists of 1 required element and 4 optional attributes.

 * <*trainer*> ::= absolute path to the [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/ LibLinear] executable trainer
  * For an Unix system, the executable file usually is under the top directory of LibLinear.   For a Windows system, it usually is under the `[windows]` directory of LibLinear.  We could have integrated the Java version of LibLinear for training, but we found that the C version of LibLinear is faster and more memory efficient.
 * attribute.*s* ::= solver type (default 3)
  * 0 - L2-regularized logistic regression
  * 1 - L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (dual)
  * 2 - L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (primal)
  * 3 - L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification (dual)
  * 4 - multi-class support vector classification by Crammer and Singer
  * 5 - L1-regularized L2-loss support vector classification
  * 6 - L1-regularized logistic regression
 * attribute.*c* ::= cost (default 0.1)
  * _C_-value as in _C_-SVM
 * attribute.*e* ::= epsilon (default 0.1)
  * Tolerance of termination criterion
 * attribute.*B* ::= bias (default -1)
  * if bias >= 0, instance x becomes [x; bias]; if < 0, no bias term added

== <*predict*> ==

The <*predict*> element is required for decoding in [DataFormat raw and pos formats].  It consists of 2 elements.

 * <*pos_model_file*> ::= absolute or relative path
  * Specifies a filename of the part-of-speech model (generated by [http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml Stanford POS-tagger]).  This element is required for decoding in a raw format.
 * <*morph_dict_dir*> ::= absolute or relative path
  * Specifies a directory path that contains dictionary files for the lemmatizer (built in ClearParser).  This element is required for decoding English in [DataFormat raw and pos formats].
