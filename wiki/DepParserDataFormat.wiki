#summary Dependency parser: data format

Clear dependency parser supports the CoNLL-X [http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/#dataformat data format].  Among all the fields, the parser requires values for

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * Lemma: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Here is an example of this format.  The last two columns (PHEAD, PDEPREL) are not required to be presented.
