#summary Dependency parser: data format

Clear dependency parser supports 3 data formats:  a raw format, a part-of-speech format, a dependency format, and the CoNLL-X format.
<br><br>

== Raw format ==

The raw format consists of a sentence per line.  This format is only for decoding and requires to specify a model for the POS tagger and a dictionary for the lemmatizer (see [DepParserGuidelines dependency parser guidelines] for more details).


{{{
Pricing details weren't immediately available.
She bought a car.
}}}

== Part-of-speech format ==

The part-of-speech format requires two fields.

 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  This format is only for decoding.  Here is an example of this format.

{{{
Pricing        NN
details        NNS
were           VBD
n't            RB
immediately    RB
available      JJ
.              .

She            PRP
bought         VBD
a              DT
car            NN
.              .
}}}

== Dependency format ==

The dependency format keeps only fields required for the parser.

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * Lemma: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`) and each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  Here is an example of this format.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for decoding.

{{{
1    Pricing        pricing        NN     2    NMOD
2    details        detail         NNS    3    SBJ
3    were           be             VBD    0    ROOT
4    n't            not            RB     3    ADV
5    immediately    immediately    RB     6    AMOD
6    available      available      JJ     3    PRD
7    .              .              .      3    P
}}}

== CoNLL-X format ==

Detailed descriptions about the CoNLL-X data format can be found from [http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/#dataformat here].  Among all the fields, the parser requires values for

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * Lemma: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`) and each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  Here is an example of this format.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for decoding.
