#summary Morphological analyzer: guidelines

Clear morphological analyzer converts word-forms to their lemmas using dictionaries and part-of-speech tags.  For example, all plural nouns are converted to their singular forms, all regular/irregular verb-forms are converted to their base-forms, etc.  The analyzer uses the [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet WordNet] dictionaries but is implemented slightly differently from their [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/morph.3WN.html morphological analyzer].  Currently, Clear morphological analyzer only supports English; more languages will be supported near in the future.
