#summary Morphological analyzer: guidelines

Clear morphological analyzer converts word-forms to their lemmas.  For example, all plural nouns are converted to their singular forms and all regular/irregular verb-forms are converted to their base-forms.  Currently, Clear morphological analyzer only supports English.  More languages will be supported near in the future.
