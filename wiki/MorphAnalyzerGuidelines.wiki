#summary Morphological analyzer: guidelines

Clear morphological analyzer converts word-forms to their lemmas using dictionaries and part-of-speech tags.  For example, all plural nouns are converted to their singular forms, all regular/irregular verb-forms are converted to their base-forms, etc.  It uses the <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/">WordNet</a> dictionaries but implemented slightly different from their <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/morph.3WN.html">morphological analyzer</a>.  Currently, Clear morphological analyzer only supports English.  More languages will be supported near in the future.
