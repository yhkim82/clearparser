#summary Phrase-to-dependency converter: guidelines

= Clear phrase-to-dependency converter =

_Clear phrase-to-dependency converter_ takes phrase structure trees in [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank format] as input and generates corresponding dependency trees in [DataFormat Clear format] as output.  The tool allows users to customize their own head-percolation rules.  It currently supports only English (support for Chinese is expected soon).

== How to run ==

On the terminal, type the following command.

{{{
Usage: java clear.engine.PhraseToDep -i <input-file> -o <output-file> -h <headrule-file> [-m <dictionary-directory> -l <language=ch|en>]
}}}

 * input file: name of a file containing phrase structure trees.
 * output file: name of a file containing dependency trees converted from the input file.
 * headrule file: name of a file containing head-percolation rules.
 * dictionary directory: path of a directory containing dictionaries for [MorphAnalyzerGuidelines Clear morphological analyzer].  If the directory is not specified, it uses word-forms as lemmas.
 * language: `ch` - Chinese (not supported yet), `en` - English (default)

'`dat`' directory includes a sample input file (`dat/sample.phrase`),  '`headrules`' directory includes a default headrule file (`headrules/choi.headrules`), and '`en_dict`' directory includes default dictionary files for English.  The following command converts phrase structure trees in '`dat/sample.phrase`' to dependency trees in '`dat/sample.dep`' by using head-percolation rules in '`headrules/choi.headrules`' and dictionaries in '`en_dict`'.

{{{
java clear.engine.PhraseToDep -i dat/sample.phrase -o dat/sample.dep -h headrules/choi.headrules -m en_dict/
}}}

== Input file ==

Clear P2D converter takes [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank style] phrase structure trees as input.  Each tree starts with either an empty phrase (example 1) or a `TOP`-phrase (example 2).

 * Example 1
