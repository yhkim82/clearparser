#summary Data format

ClearParser currently supports 5 data formats: raw, part-of-speech, dependency, CoNLL-X, and semantic role formats.

== Raw format (raw) ==

The raw format requires one sentence per line.

{{{
Pricing details weren't immediately available.
She bought a car.
}}}

== Part-of-speech format (pos) ==

The part-of-speech format requires 2 fields.

 * FORM: word form or punctuation symbol
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  This format is only for decoding and requires to specify a dictionary for the lemmatizer (see [ConfigGuidelines configuration guidelines] for more details).

{{{
Pricing        NN

n't            RB
immediately    RB

.              .

She            PRP
bought         VBD
a              DT
car            NN
.              .
}}}

== Dependency format (dep) ==

The dependency format requires 5 fields.

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * FORM: word form or punctuation symbol
 * LEMMA: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * FEATS: extra features ('`_`' indicates no extra feature)
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for decoding.

}}}

== CoNLL-X format (conll) ==

Detailed descriptions about the CoNLL-X data format can be found from [http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/#dataformat here].  Among all the fields, the parser requires values for

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * FORM: word form or punctuation symbol
 * LEMMA: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * FEATS: extra features ('`_`' indicates no extra feature)
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for decoding.

}}}

== Semantic role format (srl) ==

The semantic role labeling format requires 7 fields.

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * FORM: word form or punctuation symbol
 * LEMMA: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD
 * ROLESET: roleset ID of the current token ('`_`' indicates that this token is not a predicate)
 * SHEADS: semantic heads with labels ('`_`' indicates that this token has no semantic head)

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  The last column (SHEADS) is optional for decoding.  During decoding, the semantic role labeler considers only tokens whose ROLESET values are not '`_`' as predicates.  SHEADS takes the following format.

{{{
SHEAD  ::= headId:label
SHEADS ::= _ | SHEAD(;SHEAD)*
}}}
