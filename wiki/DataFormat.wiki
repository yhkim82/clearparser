#summary Data format

ClearParser currently supports 3 data formats: a part-of-speech format, a dependency format, and the CoNLL-X format.

== Part-of-speech format (pos) ==

The part-of-speech format requires 2 fields.

 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  This format is only for decoding and requires to specify a dictionary for the lemmatizer (see [ConfigGuidelines configuration guidelines] for more details).

.              .
}}}

== Dependency format (dep) ==

The dependency format requires 5 fields.

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * Lemma: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for dependency decoding.

5    .              .              .      2    P
}}}

== CoNLL-X format (conll) ==

Detailed descriptions about the CoNLL-X data format can be found from [http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/#dataformat here].  Among all the fields, the parser requires values for

 * ID: token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
 * Form: word form or punctuation symbol
 * Lemma: lemma or stem of word form
 * POSTAG: fine-grained part-of-speech tag
 * HEAD: head ID of the current token
 * DEPREL: dependency relation to the HEAD

Each field is delimited by a tab character (`'\t'`).  Each sentence is delimited by a blank line.  The last two columns (HEAD, DEPREL) are optional for dependency decoding.
